		 Normally, for the purpose of loading pages quickly,
		 scripts would go in the body, just before the closing </body> tag.
		 For simplicity's sake, I've put them in the <head>.
	
		 Notice, also, the path for the script.js file - normally I would
		 encourage you to set the file path as "/script.js", which means "script.js
		 is located in the root directory of the site" but I left the
		 leading slash off so you could run this in a non-server environment (ask me
		 if you want more details about that).

		 The current file path just means "script.js is located in the same
		 directory as the file that's including it". Since all the html files
		 in this project are located in the same folder, this is fine, but
		 it's important to understand the distinction.
